- Data encryption for sensitive information (Fernet AES-128)
- Password hashing with bcrypt and automatic salt generation
- Comprehensive activity logging with encryption
- Suspicious activity detection and alerting
- Secure backup and restore system with one-time codes

✅ USER MANAGEMENT:
- Hard-coded Super Administrator (super_admin/Admin_123?)
- System Administrator management
- Service Engineer management
- Role-based permission enforcement
- Profile management capabilities

✅ DATA MANAGEMENT:
- Traveller management with encrypted PII
- Scooter fleet management with GPS tracking
- Search functionality with partial matching
- CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Data validation for all inputs (formats, ranges, etc.)

✅ SYSTEM FEATURES:
- Console-based user interface
- SQLite database with encrypted sensitive data
- Comprehensive error handling
- Activity logging and audit trails
- Backup system with ZIP compression
- One-time restore codes for System Administrators

✅ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Python 3.11+ with modern libraries
- MVC architecture with service layer
- Centralized database connection management
- Modular design with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive input validation utilities
- Secure coding practices throughout

SECURITY COMPLIANCE:
===================

✅ Learning Objective 1 (LO1): Applied input validation, SQL injection prevention, and cryptography
✅ Learning Objective 2 (LO2): Understood and avoided common coding mistakes
✅ Learning Objective 3 (LO3): Implemented secure database communication
