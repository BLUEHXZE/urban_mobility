Project Information:
- Assignment: Urban Mobility Backend System
- Course: Analysis 8: Software Quality
- Version: 1.0
- Date: June 17, 2025

System Overview:
This project implements a secure backend system for Urban Mobility, featuring:
- Role-based access control (Super Admin, System Admin, Service Engineer)
- Encrypted data storage for sensitive information
- Comprehensive input validation and SQL injection protection
- Activity logging with suspicious behavior detection
- Secure backup and restore functionality

Technical Implementation:
- Language: Python 3.11+
- Database: SQLite3 with encryption
- Security: bcrypt for password hashing, Fernet for data encryption
- Architecture: MVC pattern with service layer
- Testing: Console-based interface for admin operations

Security Features:
- Input validation using whitelisting approach
- Parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection attacks
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data (usernames, PII, logs)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based authorization with centralized access control
- Comprehensive activity logging with encryption
- Suspicious activity detection and alerting

Compliance:
This system meets all requirements specified in the assignment document
and implements industry best practices for secure software development.
